# Setup

1. Install Go version 1.11.4 or later
1. Install mongodb (if it is not already installed, or run it from Docker)
1. Start mongodb (if it is not already running)
1. Clone this repo
1. Change directory to the path you cloned the repo into
1. Source the `env.sh` file
1. Execute `make buildable` to install the various Go tools needed for building and editing the project

For example:

```
brew install go
brew install mongo
brew services start mongodb
git clone https://github.com/tidepool-org/platform.git
cd platform
. ./env.sh
make buildable
```

# Execute

1. Setup the environment, as above.
1. Build the project.
1. Execute a service.

In addition to the setup above, for example:

```
make build
_bin/services/data/data
```

Use `Ctrl-C` to stop the executable. It may take up to 60 seconds to stop.

# Makefile

* To setup your Go environment for building and editing the project:

```
make buildable
```

* To build the executables:

```
make build
```

All executables are built to the `_bin` directory in a hierarchy that matches the locations of executable source files.

The environment variable `BUILD` indicates which executables to build. If not specified, then all executables are built. For example, to build just the executables found in the `services` directory:

```
BUILD=services make build
```

* To run all of the tests manually:

```
make test
```

The environment variable `TEST` indicates which package hierarchy to test. If not specified, then all packages are tested. For example,

```
TEST=user make test
```

* To run all of the tests automatically after any changes are made, in a separate terminal window:

```
make test-watch
```

The environment variable `WATCH` indicates which package hierarchy to test. If not specified, then all packages are tested. For example,

```
WATCH=user make test-watch
```

* To run `gofmt`, `goimports`, `go vet`, and `golint`:

```
make pre-commit
```

* To clean the project of all build files:

```
make clean
```

# Sublime Text

If you use the Sublime Text editor with the GoSublime plugin, open the `platform.sublime-project` project to ensure the `GOPATH` and `PATH` environment variables are set correctly within Sublime Text. In addition, the recommended user settings are:

```
{
  "autocomplete_builtins": true,
  "autocomplete_closures": true,
  "autoinst": false,
  "fmt_cmd": [
    "goimports"
  ],
  "fmt_enabled": true,
  "fmt_tab_width": 4,
  "use_named_imports": true
}
```

# Upgrade Golang Version

## Prepare

**Before** you update this repository to use a newer version of Golang, please perform these checks:

- Review the release notes for **all** Golang versions, major and minor, from the current Golang version to the target Golang version. The entire Golang release history can be found at https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html.
  - For major revisions, if any change described in the release notes could have a negative impact upon this repository, follow up and review any associated issues and the updated code. Make note of this change in order to explicitly test after upgrading.
  - For minor revisions, review all issues included in the associated GitHub milestone issue tracker. These can be found in the minor revision release notes. If any issue could have a negative impact upon this repository, review the updated code. Make note of this issue in order to explicitly test after upgrading.
- Install `gimme`(https://github.com/travis-ci/gimme) via `brew`. Execute `gimme -k`. Ensure that the target Golang version is listed. The `gimme` tool is used by Travis CI to manage Golang versions. If the version is not listed, then the Travis CI build will not succeed.
- Browse to https://hub.docker.com/_/golang and ensure the target Golang version in an Alpine Linux image is available. For example, if the target version is `1.11.4`, then ensure that the `1.11.4-alpine` image tag is available. If the image tag is not avaiable, then the Travis CI build will not succeed.

## Upgrade

Ensure you are using the target Golang version locally.

Change the version in `.travis.yml` and all `Dockerfile.*` files.

Add an entry in `CHANGELOG.md` and commit.

## Test

Ensure the `ci-build` and `ci-test` Makefile targets pass using the target Golang version.

If you previously noted any changes or issues of concern, perform any explicit tests necessary.

# Upgrade Dependencies

## Upgrade

```
go get -u <dependacy>   # e.g. go get -u github.com/onsi/gomega
go mod tidy
go mod vendor
```

## Review

Review all pending changes to all dependencies. If any changes could have a negative impact upon this repository, make note of this change to explicitly test afterwards.

## Test

Ensure the `ci-build` and `ci-test` Makefile targets pass using the target Golang version.

If you previously noted any changes or issues of concern, perform any explicit tests necessary.
